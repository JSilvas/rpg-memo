# rpg-memo

## Summary
Memo is a "digital sticky note" widget for Android that enforces prioritization through spatial constraints. Inspired by retro RPG inventory systems (e.g., Resident Evil 4, Deus Ex), users manage tasks as physical "blocks" on a grid. There is no scrolling; if a task doesn't fit, something else must be completed or deleted. It lives entirely on the Home Screen as a native widget.
